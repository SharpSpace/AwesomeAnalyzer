# JJ0200
Class can be converted to struct for better performance.

## Description
This analyzer detects small, immutable classes that would benefit from being defined as structs instead. Structs can provide better performance for small value types as they are allocated on the stack rather than the heap.

## Criteria
A class is suggested for conversion to struct when ALL of the following are true:
- The class is small (≤3 fields/properties)
- All fields are `readonly` or `const`
- All properties are immutable (only `get` or `init` accessors, no `set`)
- The class does not inherit from another class (except `System.Object`)
- The class does not implement any interfaces
- The class has no virtual members
- The class is not `static` or `abstract`

## Violation
```C#
public class Point
{
    public readonly int X;
    public readonly int Y;
}
```

## Fix
```C#
public struct Point
{
    public readonly int X;
    public readonly int Y;
}
```

## Notes
- Structs are value types and are typically allocated on the stack
- This can reduce GC pressure and improve performance for small, frequently-used types
- Be cautious with larger structs as copying becomes more expensive
- This analyzer is conservative and does not suggest conversion for classes with interfaces, even though structs can implement interfaces
